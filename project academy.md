## Project Overview

### Overview

Peer to peer learning

makes learning multiplayer 

Through the Internet, a lot of information is available, but access to information does not guarantee learning. In most educational systems, teachers are the ones who facilitate learning. They give feedback, evaluate student work, and preserve learning materials. Teachers are often the bottlenecks of education systems because they are difficult to scale up and in some cases very expensive. elnido.network will build a peer learning ecosystem in which learners, teachers and tutors educate each other.

theblock.academy was born as a decentralized protocol focused on education and its participants, which allows the creation and sharing of spaces and content while preserving Intellectual Property, in addition to rewarding the good participation of users, people or institutions through Smart Contracts. Global censorship free. Through a Marketplace training courses in the blockchain ecosystem, which allows participants to acquire knowledge focused on the development of technological solutions that contribute to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. 

Education is the backbone for creating critical mass and global social well-being. Interconnection without barriers is now possible. The Learning Platform will allow the integration of facilitators and students in the teaching-learning process, the system will be based on rewards for each level passed, a vital tool for adoption, inclusion 


### Project Details

Implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS), as a tool that allows users to publicize the fundamental elements of the polkadot and kusama blockchain, through an educational program prepared and executed by a team of facilitators, who will guide to the participants through a system of tutorials that allow them to monitor the progress of the students, through a system of evaluations and technical challenges, supported by a system of rewards.

Technical components to be developed in the execution of the project

1. Smart Contract
2. Dapp (LMS)
3. Wallet Extention
